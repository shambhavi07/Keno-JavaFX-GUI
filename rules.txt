Keno Rules

Keno is a lottery draw-style game that's easy to play.  
For each Keno drawing, 20 numbers out of 80 will be selected as winning numbers.
You can decide how many of these numbers (called Spots) and exactly which numbers you will try to match.
You can select 1,2,8 or 10 spots. For example, if a 8-Spot game is selected, a total of 8 numbers from 1 to 80 would be selected.
If you played that 8-Spot game for $1 and matched your 8 numbers to 8 of the winning numbers for that draw, you would win $10,000.

Steps

1. Select your bet. The winning  gets multiplied by the amount you selected.
2. Select how many consecutive draws to play.
3. Select the number of spots. 
4. Pick as many numbers as selected in spots or select random pick.
5. Press the draw button to play.
6. You can reset your game after drawing is over by pressing the clear button.
